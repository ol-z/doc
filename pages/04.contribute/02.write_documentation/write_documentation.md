## Via GitHub

The YunoHost documentation is managed through a [Git repository](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc). You can send pull-requests, and do not forget to report your issues.

The old online editor doesn't work anymore, because it didn't support uploading files (e.g. images).

## Syntax

This page uses the markdown syntax, please refer to the [documentation](/doc_markdown_guide) for further information.
