## Via GitHub

The YunoHost documentation is managed through a [Git repository](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc). You can send pull-requests, and do not forget to report your issues.

Because the online editor doesn't support uploading files, using Git is the prefered way if you need to upload media (e.g. images).

## Syntax

This page uses the markdown syntax, please refer to the [documentation](/doc_markdown_guide) for further information.
